# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to represent our ability as data scientists to find interesting data sets, pose research questions, explore data using summary statistics and visualizations and build linear prediciton models.  

# Required Packages


# Data
This data was collected from hotels in Portugal, with the aim of creating prediction models. Because this is real data from hotels, all identifying information for hotels and customers has been removed from the data.

This dataset can be found in the modeldata package on R.
The data can be accesed using the following R code if you already have the necessary packages installed.
```{R}
library(modeldata)
data("hotel_rates")
```
More information on the data used can be found at the following links:  

[Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#f0010)  
[Hotels](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-11)

For our purposes we removed the `historical_adr` variable from the R dataset since it does not appear to be part of the original data.

## Variables
The information on the following variables was found at the above links.
